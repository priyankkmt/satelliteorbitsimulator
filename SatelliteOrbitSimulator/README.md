The Solar System Simulator is a simple application built using Qt that allows users to simulate the orbits of celestial bodies in our solar system. The simulator provides basic controls to start, stop, reset, and update the positions of the celestial bodies.

## Features

- Visualize the orbits of celestial bodies in our solar system.
- Start and stop the simulation.
- Reset the positions of the celestial bodies.
- Update the simulation based on the user-defined number of days.
- Adjust the speed of the simulation.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler with C++11 support.
- Qt framework (version X.X or later).

## How to Build and Run

1. Clone the repository:
   
**Note**: Make sure to replace "your-username" with your actual GitHub username and update any other details as needed.
